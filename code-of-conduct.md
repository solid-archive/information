# Code of Conduct

Participants in the Solid community are expected to behave professionally and
respectfully. This community is committed to maintain a positive and
constructive community while helping to build Solid. This commitment calls for a
community where participants behave according to the rules of the following Code
of Conduct:

- Do not consume excessive resources. Solid is not a general backup facility; it provides managed access to Linked Data resources. Community Managers reserve the right to [close accounts](#closing-accounts) being used for bulk storage or computation. Indications of bulk storage include inappropriate media (disk images, audio or video files, tarballs or zip files). For the time being, disk storage is limited to 25 Megabytes. If users wish to propose a paid service, please contact a Community Manager.
- Communicate and behave with respect, professionalism, fairness, and
sensitivity.
- Communicate constructively and avoid demeaning or insulting behavior or
language.
- Be welcoming. We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports people of
all backgrounds and identities. This includes, but is not limited to, members of
any race, religion, national origin, sexual orientation, and gender identity and
expression.
- Do not insult or put down other participants. Harassment (whether verbal,
physical or sexual) and other exclusionary behavior are not acceptable.
- Disagreements, both social and technical, happen all the time. Whenever
inappropriate behaviors are observed members of the community should strive to
bring the discussion back to a more professional level. In most cases
misunderstandings and disagreements can be resolved informally. Do not hesitate
to contact Core Contributors or the Community Manager if you feel that your
concerns are not being sufficiently addressed. We hope that most concerns can be
solved this way. However, if one person believes another's behavior is
inappropriate (inconsistent with the Code of Conduct or the good working of the
group), and ordinary communication between them is not possible, escalation of
the issue can take place by contacting a Core Contributor. They may temporarily
or permanently ban an individual from participating in activities, e.g. in a
chat, mail or in Git for acting against the Code of Conduct.

## Best practices for the Solid Community include:

- Contribute! Help Solid be the best it can be. Work together constructively
toward the good working of the technology.
- Stay on topic. Remember others voices need to be heard as well as yours and
you must allow the space for other members to participate (e.g.: don't monologue
or respond to every comment.).
- Respect the expertise and contributions of other members of the community
(e.g.: don't assume that you are "the smartest person in the room"). Remember
that this is a community with different backgrounds who have valuable
contributions to make.
- Listen first and be sure you understand the point of view of the other person
(e.g.: don't assume that others are disagreeing with you because they don't
understand what you’re saying and don't suggest that another person's comments
are invalid because they have a different opinion).
- Respond from an informed and inclusive point of view (e.g.: don't respond to
comments without reading the background information).
- Do review the work of others to see if you are doing something which other
groups have already done (ie: “reinventing the wheel”).
- Know that your contribution is still valuable even if it is not integrated.
- Remember the work is about more than just your area of interest (e.g.: don't
let your personal or professional goals impede the progress of the group).
- Do contact a Community Manager if you feel someone has been working in a way
that is having a negative impact on the work of the group, if they are insulting
or harassing you, or unfairly impeding your own ability to work
- Maintain an open mindset and encourage others to do the same. There might be
things you or others haven't heard about yet, so be open to send and receive
pointers to more info.
- There are multiple ways of achieving the same goals, but when you build
something new, check what already exists so we can better understand and help
you with your contribution.

## Closing accounts

- Account owners may close their own accounts. Community Managers may choose to close accounts of users violating the [Code of Conduct](#code-of-conduct).
- Before closing down an account, Community Managers will notify the owner of the account.
- The account owner will be given a week to contest the decision to close the account or to recover any data they need from the account before it is disabled.
